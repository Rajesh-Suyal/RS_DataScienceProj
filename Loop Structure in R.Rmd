##This page demonstrate how loops can be avoided in R

###Iterating using FOR loop on the elements of a vector

##### In this example we will use __FOR loop__ to calculate the Square of 10 random nos. Fist we will initialize the numbers for calculation. i.e. create random nos.<br />
x <- rnorm(10) <br />
sqrx <- 0  * this is empty variable which will hold the result i.e. square of x. <br />
<br />
for(i in 1:10) <br />
{  <br />
    sqrx[i] <- x[i] * x[i]  <br />
    print(sqrx[i])  <br />
}  <br />
print(i)  <br /><br /><br />

##### Above code could have been written in more easier way and without using for loop. Also in just one line. This shows the power of Vectors in R. <br /><br />

sqrx_1 <- x ^ 2
<br />

sqrx == sqrx_1
<br />
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
<br /><br />

##### Here because x is a vector having 10 random numbers, we raise x with power of 2. What this will do is, it will apply ^2 to each element of vector. Hence we do not have to iterate to each element using a loop. <br /> This is power of R and Vectors.
