Hello everyone this is Rajesh Suyal, I am learning Data Science through Coursera and this is my first interaction with R programming language, I feel very happy to get a chance to learn a very interesting language like R.

  I have been working in SAP Business Objects for more than 10 years and I have learning other programming languages like Java, VB etc.. I really wanted to advance my career in Data Science and Coursera is perfect for me start learning Data Science and R.
  
  I would also like to get connected with you all genius people and take help from your knowledge.

  Wish you all happy learning as learning never stop. ÔÅä
